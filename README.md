🔧 Configuration
The system uses a YAML configuration file (config/config.yaml) for settings:

data:
  use_simulated: true          # Use simulated data for testing
  simulated_samples: 10000     # Number of simulated samples
  test_size: 0.2              # Train/test split ratio

models:
  random_forest:
    n_estimators: 100
    max_depth: 10
  svm:
    kernel: 'rbf'
    C: 1.0

detection:
  dos_threshold: 0.7          # Attack detection threshold
📊 Detection Models
Supervised Models
Random Forest: Ensemble method, good for feature importance
Support Vector Machine: Effective for high-dimensional data
Unsupervised Models
Isolation Forest: Good for anomaly detection
One-Class SVM: Novelty detection
🎯 Attack Types Detected
SYN Flood
UDP Flood
HTTP Flood
ICMP Flood
Generic DoS attacks
📈 Dashboard Features
Real-time traffic monitoring
Attack detection visualization
Model performance metrics
Alert management
Traffic pattern analysis
System status monitoring
🔍 Data Format
The system expects network traffic data with features such as:

Source/Destination Ports
Protocol
Packet lengths and counts
Flow duration and rates
TCP flags and states
Label (BENIGN or attack type)
CICIDS2017 Dataset
To use the real CICIDS2017 dataset:

Download from the official source
Place CSV files in the data/ directory
Update config.yaml to point to your data files
Set use_simulated: false
📝 Logging
The system logs all activities to dos_detection.log and console output. Log levels can be configured in the configuration file.

🚨 Alerts
The system generates alerts when:

Attack traffic exceeds threshold
Sudden traffic spikes detected
Abnormal patterns identified
🔧 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Import Errors: Ensure all dependencies are installed

pip install -r requirements.txt
Memory Issues: Reduce simulated data size in config

data:
  simulated_samples: 5000
Model Training Fails: Check data format and preprocessing

Performance Tips
Use smaller datasets for faster training
Random Forest is faster than SVM for large datasets
Enable SMOTE for better class balancing
